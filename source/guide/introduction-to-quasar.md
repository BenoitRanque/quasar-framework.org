## What is Quasar?
Quasar is the ultimate framework (powered with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)) that you'll need when developing:
* A (responsive) website
* A PWA (Progressive Web App)
* A Mobile App (Android, iOS, ...) through Cordova
* An Electron App

Write code once then simultaneously deploy as website, PWA, Mobile App and/or Electron App using the same base-code. All it takes is just changing a parameter to the build command.

Quasar offers very fast web components so you can design an app in record time. And it's not just about components. When using Quasar you won't need additional heavy libraries like Hammerjs, Momentjs or Bootstrap. It got that covered too, and with a small footprint!

## Why Quasar?
Because of what is offered out of the box. Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quasarframework) account for testimonials.

### All Platforms in One Go
One source code for all platforms simultaneously: responsive desktop/mobile website, PWAs (Progressive Web Apps), native mobile Apps (that really look native!) and Electron apps.

### Top class, fast web components
There's almost a component for every needs you might have. All these components are carefully crafted to offer the best possible experience to your users. **Quasar is designed with performance & responsiveness in mind** -- so the overhead of using Quasar is barely noticeable. We take great pride in this.

### Best practices integrated by default
You don't need to worry about what the best practices in web development are. You get that for free out of the box. HTML/CSS/JS minification, cache busting, tree shaking, sourcemapping, code-splitting & lazy loading, ES6 transpiling, linting code. This just barely scratches the surface. Quasar takes care of this for you. No configuration needed.

### Two Themes (more to come)
Material theme and iOS theme.

### Progressively migrate your existing project
Quasar offers an UMD (Unified Module Definition) version which means you can add a CSS and JS HTML tag into existing project and you're ready to use it. No build step is required.

### Unparalleled developer experience through Quasar CLI
You'll benefit from:
* State preserving hot-reload when you make changes to your source code, no matter if you develop a PWA, a Mobile App (directly on your phone or on an emulator) or an Electron app. Change code and watch it get updated on the fly, without the need of any page refresh.
* State preserving compilation error overlay.
* Lint-on-save with ESLint -- if you like linting your code only
* ES6 code transpiling
* Sourcemaps
* Changing build options won't require you to manually reload the dev server

Again, this is barely scratching the surface.

### Get up to speed fast
The top class starter kit will make it easy for you to get up to speed. Bring an idea to reality in record time. All the heavy lifting is done for you, not by you. You will just need to focus on your features and let the boilerplating be done by Quasar.

### Awesome ever-growing community
Whenever you got a problem you can't or don't know yet how to solve, visit Quasar forum or Gitter chat. The community is there to help you.

### Wide platform support
Google Chrome, Firefox, IE11/Edge, Safari, Opera, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry.

### Great documentation
Finally, it's worth mentioning about the huge amount of time that is spent on writing great, bloat free, focused, complete documentation pages so that you can quickly pick up Quasar. There will be no room for confusion.

## Underlying technologies
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

Except for Vue, which takes half a day to pick up and will change you forever, you are not really required to know the other technologies. Most of them are integrated and already configured for you.

## Get started in under a minute
Having said this, let's [get started](/guide/index.html)! You'll be running a website or app in under a minute.

title: Ajax Requests
---
Quasar recommends using `Axios` or `Vue-Resource`.

> These packages are not provided by default so you will have to npm install them, create an [app plugin](/guide/app-plugins.html) and edit `/quasar.conf.js` to tell Quasar to use them.

- Get started with [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

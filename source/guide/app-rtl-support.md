title: RTL Support (Experimental)
---
RTL (right to left) support is in its very early development stages, **so experimental, not fit for production yet**, with some bugs. Due to lack of time, we ask the community for help. Please contact us on forum/Gitter/email if you are interested in giving a helping hand.

## Enabling experimental RTL
To enable the currently **experimental RTL**, you need to edit `/quasar.conf.js`:
```js
build: {
  rtl: true
}
```

This will convert to RTL both your website/app code & Quasar code.
